# Zoo Management System

Hello Everyone,

My name is Ramy Tawfik, This is my ePortfolio to show my work for my CS-499 Computer Science Capstone My final class of myComputer Science Degree at Southern New Hampshire University. 

I have learned many important concepts and skills in the Computer Science program. I learned about the software development life cycle “ Agile and waterfall”. Agile methodology was a new concept for me, and I learned a lot of important information about it and how to use Agile methodology while developing a software product. I also learned about object-oriented programing concepts and gained important skills when I develop software using different programming languages. I also learned C++, Java. these are very important and powerful programming languages that will help me in my career. I also learned other skills that I will use such as problem-solving skills and critical thinking skills.

## Selected artifact
I will be working on the final project for IT-145 which I developed using Java more than a year ago. The project was developing a console application as an authentication system for a Zoo

## Existing functionality

The application was required to follow this scenario 

1. Ask a user for a username.
2. Ask a user for a password.
3. Convert the password using a message digest five (MD5) hash.
4. Check the credentials against the valid credentials provided in the file (use the hashed passwords in the second column; the third       column contains the actual passwords for testing).
5. Limit failed attempts to three before notifying the user and exiting.
6. After successful authentication, uses the role in the credential file to display the correct system information loaded from the          specific role file. 
7. Allow a user to log out.
8. Stays on the credential screen until either a successful attempt has been made, three unsuccessful attempts have been made, or a        user chooses to exit.
